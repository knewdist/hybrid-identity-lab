# Hybrid Identity Lab

Enterprise-style identity lab demonstrating Active Directory, hybrid identity with Microsoft Entra ID, authentication flows, and security hardening.

This project simulates a **real corporate identity environment** combining:

- Active Directory Domain Services
- DNS / Kerberos authentication
- Tiered administrative model
- Group Policy governance
- Hybrid identity with Microsoft Entra ID
- Identity synchronization and SSO
- Authentication monitoring and troubleshooting

The goal of this lab is to **develop practical IAM, system administration, and troubleshooting skills** using technologies found in modern enterprise environments.

# Lab Architecture
Client Workstation (CL01)
│
│ Kerberos Authentication
│
Domain Controllers
├ DC01 (Core)
└ DC02 (GUI)

│
│ Identity Management
│
File Server
└ FS01

│
│ Hybrid Identity (Phase 8+)
│
Microsoft Entra ID
Tenant: simmonsalanproton.onmicrosoft.com


This architecture demonstrates both:

• **Traditional enterprise identity (Active Directory)**  
• **Modern cloud identity (Microsoft Entra ID)**
