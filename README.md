# Hybrid Identity Lab

Enterprise-style identity lab demonstrating Active Directory, hybrid identity with Microsoft Entra ID, authentication flows, and security hardening.

This project simulates a **real corporate identity environment** combining:

- Active Directory Domain Services
- DNS / Kerberos authentication
- Tiered administrative model
- Group Policy governance
- Hybrid identity with Microsoft Entra ID
- Identity synchronization and SSO
- Authentication monitoring and troubleshooting

  ## Cloud Identity & Zero Trust Controls

The lab also demonstrates modern cloud identity security using Microsoft Entra ID.

Key capabilities implemented:

• Conditional Access policies  
• Privileged Identity Management (PIM)  
• Identity Protection risk detection  
• Risk-based MFA enforcement  

These controls simulate a modern **Zero Trust identity architecture** used in enterprise environments.

The goal of this lab is to **develop practical IAM, system administration, and troubleshooting skills** using technologies found in modern enterprise environments.

This architecture demonstrates both:

Traditional enterprise identity using Active Directory Domain Services

Modern cloud identity using Microsoft Entra ID

Hybrid identity synchronization between on-prem and cloud environments
